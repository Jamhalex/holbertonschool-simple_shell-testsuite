# Simple Shell – Shared Test Suite

This repository contains a **community-driven test suite** for the
Holberton Simple Shell project (tasks 0–20).

The goal is to provide a single, consistent reference suite that compares
student shells against `/bin/sh` and validates both regular behavior and
edge cases.

## How to run

Build your shell, then run:

```bash
HSH=/path/to/your/hsh ./checker.bash
